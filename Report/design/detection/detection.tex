\section{Computer Vision}

The computer vision subsystem is a software component that is designed to recognise and track vehicles in images in order to count them and estimate their speed, henceforth to be referred to as the \emph{detection} component of the system. Each time an image is processed by the detection algorithm several subprocesses are performed in order to manipulate the original image into a state where vehicles have been isolated. These subprocesses can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:detection_design}. The vehicle tracking subprocess was largely influenced by the work of Adrian Rosebrock \cite{adrian_rosebrock_simple_object_tracking}\cite{adrian_rosebrock_vehicle_tracking} of PyImageSearch and the vehicle segmentation subprocess was influenced by the work of Andrey Nikishaev \cite{andrey_nikishaev_traffic_counting}. Much of the functionality is provided by the Python open source computer vision library, OpenCV \cite{opencv}

\subsection{Tracking}

Tracking is follows an objects movement across multiple images. This requires that the object be reidentified in each new image and matched to it's old location.

\subsection{Speed Estimation and Counting}

This subprocess consolidates the efforts of the former ones and convert the information about an objects position into vehicle counts and speeds.
