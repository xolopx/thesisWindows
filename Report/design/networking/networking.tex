\section{Data Transfer}

Integral to the system is the ability to trasmit statistics generated by a node to a database in a different machine, furthermore it's useful to be able to transmit a video feed from a node to the user interface. Presently data transfer occurs only on a local area network.

\subsection{Video Feed}

The video feed is shared with the user interface via a simple Flask \cite{flask} application that's sole purpose is to upload new images to a local web address. Flask is a lightweight web framework for custom web services which made it optimal for the specific and small task of streaming images from a Raspberry Pi on a local network. The user interface inserts the video URL on its main page so that the user may view them.


\subsection{Traffic Statistics}

Traffic statistics are recorded every 30 seconds and so must be sent to the database that frequently. A simple custom library was written to interface with the database informed by the "MySQLTutorial" series \cite{mysqltutorial} and utilizing the MySQLConnector class \cite{mysqlconnector}. The connection using this library is by default set to transfer control protocol (TCP) which is well suited to sending small packets of data.
