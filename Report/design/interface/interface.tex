\section{User Interface}

The user interface is a web application implemented using the Flask web framework. It is lightweight and provides a user with the functionality to query data from the database for a given node and time range and have that data represented in plots or for it to be downloaded as a csv file. 

The interface is a single page broken into four components, the profile of the selected node which displays relevant information to that end, the live video feed of the selected node and the count and speed statistics for the selected node and datetime range.
