\section{The Gaussian}
\label{section:gaussian}


The Gaussian provides a consistent model for normal distributions, aka the bell curve, as in Figure \ref{fig:gauss} \& \ref{fig:gausssurf}. Normal distributions follow the \emph{central limit theorem} where in if a histogram is taken of a sufficiently large number of independent random variables they will distribute with a central most probable value and symmetrically fall away either side of this value. Many datasets follow this trend closely enough that the Gaussian can be used to approximate a probability distribution for them. 

The Gaussian function  is defined by three parameters, its mean $\mu$, standard deviation $\sigma$ and amplitude $A$.

  The general one dimensional Gaussian is described:  

\begin{equation}
    f(x) = \frac{A}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}
\label{eq:gauss}
\end{equation}

  The mean value, the central limit, of the sample distribution is the value that has the greatest likelihood\footnote{Likelihood is the value of the distribution given a fixed sample. Probability is the value of a sample given a fixed distribution.} in the distribution. The standard deviation is how much the distribution is spread out, the greater the standard deviation the fatter the distribution. The amplitude is the likelihood at the mean of the distribution. In Figure \ref{fig:gauss}, for example, the likelihood of a value being 0 is 2. Generally, the curve is used to determine a sample's probability density within a value range. This is the area under the distribution given an interval and is calculated using integration, as shown in \ref{eq:gausseg}.
  
\begin{equation}
    P(x) = \int_{a}^{b}\frac{A}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}dx
    \label{eq:gausseg}
\end{equation}

Data sets can have many dimensions and distributions need to be able to express all of them. The notation for a multi-variate Gaussian distribution, for a k-dimensional random vector $ \bm{X} = (X_1,\hdots,X_k)^T$, is

\begin{equation}
    \bm{X} \sim \mathcal{N}_k(\mu,\,\sigma^{2})
\label{eq:multigauss}
\end{equation}
