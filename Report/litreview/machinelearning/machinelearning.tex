\section{Machine Learning}

Machine learning is a method of identifying patterns in data and if the data is in a digital format then machine learning can be implemented in software algorithms. Data can be many things, images, birth dates, eye colour or romance novels, to name a few. There are many techniques that implement machine learning to sort data into groups but all techniques require data to classify. Supervised machine learning algorithms require that data samples be labelled so that it knows which class they're meant to be. This allows the algorithm's response to be improved so that when un-labelled data is presented it has been trained to handle it. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms do not require labelled data samples but can still classify data though it is not know by the algorithm whether or not the groupings are correct, these methods of classification do not get feedback from a training process. \cite{patterns_machine_learning}.

This section of the report will discuss Artificial Neural Networks which are usually a supervised learning method and clustering a type of unsupervised learning.
