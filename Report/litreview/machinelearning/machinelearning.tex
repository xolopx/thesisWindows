\section{Machine Learning}

Machine learning is a method of identifying patterns in data and if the data is in a digital format then it could be implemented in software algorithms. Data can be many things, images, birth dates, eye colour or romance novels, to name a few. There are many techniques that implement machine learning to sort data into groups but all techniques require data to classify. Supervised machine learning algorithm requires that data be labelled so that it is knows which class it's meant to be in and thus its response can be improved so that when unlabelled data is presented it will sort it into the correct class. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms do not require labelled data but also seek to classify data though it is not know by the algorithm whether or not the groupings are correct \cite{patterns_machine_learning}.

This section of the report will discuss Artificial Neural Networks, commonly a type of surpervised learning and Clustering a type of unsupervised learning.
