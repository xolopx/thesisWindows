\section{Computer Vision}

Computer vision attempts to solve the problem of replicating the functionality of human vision with a machine, specifically the extraction of useful information from images. This is a difficult problem to solve however, as in any given image we are supplied with insufficient information to fully specify as solution. Computer vision attempts to compensate for this lack of information by using physical and probabilistic models to produce high fidelity results. Advancements in computing power and access to larger and larger data sets has seen computer vision increasingly become a potential solution to old problems \cite{alg_apps}. There are many different techniques and areas of study within the field of computer vision and this section of the report outlines but a small fraction of them relevant to the subject matter of this report.
