\subsection{Clustering}
Clustering is a method of segmenting an image into disjoint sets known as classes. This is useful for separating types of features or objects in an image. For example in Figure \ref{fig:toycar} the toy car has been segmented from the background.

	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\linewidth}
      		\centering\includegraphics[width=220pt]{toyCar}
      		\caption{Image by Gustavo, Upsplash.}
		    \label{fig:toycarA}
    	\end{subfigure}%
    	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\linewidth}
      		\centering\includegraphics[width=220pt]{toycarseg}
      		\caption{Segmentation of car from background.}
       		\label{fig:toycarB}
    	\end{subfigure}

In an image every pixel can be individually classified or groups of pixels known as superpixels may be treated as single entities. Entities are sorted based on their similarity. For example, a pixel's intensity is a feature that could be used to cluster it with other pixels of similar intensity. As seen in (\ref{eq:featurevector}) an entity's comparable traits may be represented by a feature vector. An entity may have any number of features which as also regarded as dimensions, $d$. 

\begin{equation}
    \vec{v} = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        d_1 \\
        d_2 \\
        \vdots \\ 
        d_n
    \end{bmatrix}
    \label{eq:featurevector}
\end{equation}
