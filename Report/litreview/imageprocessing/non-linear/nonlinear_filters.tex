\subsection{Nonlinear Filtering}

Non-linear filtering refers to a set of operations that, like linear filters, are performed on a neighborhood of pixels in a digital image and have a filter kernel that defines the filter's behaviour. Unlike linear filters, the application of nonlinear filters is not linearly shift invariant, however there are scenarios where a non-linear filter can achieve unique or superior results to linear filters. A non-linear filter's application to an image is not simply it's convolution with that image but will follow a an filter specific algorithm. 

This section of the report details some of the nonlinear filters relevant to the reports subject matter.
