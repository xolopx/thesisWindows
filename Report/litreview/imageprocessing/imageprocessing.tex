\section{Image Processing}

Image processing is the modification of digital image via the application of one or many techniques in order to change its appearance or extract some information from it, such techniques can be used to sharpen edges, remove noise, apply blur, rotate an image and perform image compression. These techniques are performed by software and can be described mathematically and algorithmically. The following sections describe some image processing fundamentals and image processing techniques relevant to the system that is the subject of this report.
