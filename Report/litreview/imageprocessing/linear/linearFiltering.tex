\subsection{Linear Filtering}

Linear filtering of an image is an interaction between a filter and a digital image. The output of this operation is the result of the weighted average of the image pixels in a neighborhood specified by the location and size of the filter. The mathematical operation that describes the weighted average produced by the interaction of a linear filter with an image is called convolution (see sections \ref{subsection:corr} \& \ref{subsection:conv}). A filter is characterised by its \emph{kernel}, K, which is comprised of coefficients, or weights, that affect the output of the filter. Convolution multiplies each of the filter's coefficients with its corresponding pixel, sums the results of each multiplication and stores it at the location matching the filter's origin in the output image. Figure \ref{fig:kernel_graphics} visualizes a single kernel application where the filter placed over a neighborhood of pixels in a digital image. The reference pixel is the location for which the result is stored in the output image, to perform this operation on the entire image the process is repeated with the reference pixel centered over every pixel in the image \cite{alg_apps}. Figure \ref{fig:generalForm} shows the general form of a linear filter kernel and that the divisor that determines the value of the result is the sum of all coefficients in the filter kernel.
