\section{Contour Tracing}

Contour tracing also known as boundary tracing or border following is a method of locating images in a binary image by tracing their perimeter. It does so by generating a list of coordinates that comprise the outline of a connected-component of 1-pixels. 

The specific algorithm utilized in this system works was designed by Satoshi Suzuki in 1985 \cite{satoshi_findContours}. The algorithm works by identifying that a pixel is the edge of an object, determining if the border belongs to a hole or is the outer border of an object and labelling it accordingly. An important notation when considering this algorithm is that of 4- (8-) connectedness of a 1-pixel. A 4-connected pixel is a neighbour to every one of the pixels that touches it edges and an 8-connected pixel is a neighbour to every pixel that touches it edges and corners. Connectedness is used to determine if a pixel is part of a connected-component. Figure \ref{fig:connectedness} illustrates what these connections look like and Figure \ref{fig:connection_examples} illustrates some examples of 1-pixel connected-components and how they're connected.

When the algorithm is performed the cells of the image are scanned in a raster fashion (left to right, top to bottom) and when a 1-pixel is encountered the algorithm interrupts and determines the type of border the pixel is that it ran into to. There are two types of border a hole border and an outer border. Figure \ref{fig:borders} illustrates these two types of borders. Satoshi defines a border point to be one that has a 0-pixel in its 4- (8-) neighborhood. An outer border is one surrounded by 0-pixel connected component and a hole border is one that surrounds a 0-pixel component. If a border is has thickness of only one pixel and is satisfies both being an outer border and hole border it's regarded as an outer border. The high-level outline of the algorithm is specified in Algorithm \ref{algorithm:satoshi} though the source material \cite{satoshi_findContours} should be consulted for a more comprehensive description.
