\subsection{Contour Tracing}

Contour tracing also known as boundary tracing or border following is a method of locating images in an image by tracing their perimeter. It does so by generating a list of coordinates that comprise the outline of a connected-component of 1-pixels in a binary image. 


The specific algorithm utilized in this system works only for binary images and was designed by Satoshi Suzuki in 1983 \cite{satoshi_findContours}.
