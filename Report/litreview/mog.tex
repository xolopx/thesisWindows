\section{Mixture of Gaussians}

Method of modelling each background pixel by a mixture of K Gaussian distributions. 

Each background colour is represented by a Gaussian. A colour is most likely background if it stays static longer. Static single-colour objects form tight clusters in the colour space while moving ones form wide clusters due to different reflecting surfaces during movement. 

\subsection{Background Subtraction}

This is performed by identifying a background image and then subtracting this image from subsequent frames of video to determine what has changed and hence what is a foreground image.

\subsection{Expectation Maximization}

This is an optimization scheme used to fit a Gaussian Mixture Model. It is an iterative method that faurantees convergence to a local maximum in a search space.
