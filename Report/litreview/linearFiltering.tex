\section{Linear Filtering}

Filtering an image is a way to augment or extract information from it. Linear filtering is a mathematical operation on a neighbourhood of pixels in an image that outputs a weighted average of the pixels in that neighbourhood. It is the weightings of a filter, known as filter coefficients, that determine the effect of the filter. These weights are stored in a matrix called a mask or kernel (see Figure \ref{fig:generalForm}) that's then convolved with an image (see sections \ref{subsection:corr} \& \ref{subsection:conv}).

     Kernel  = \frac{1}{\sum\limits_{i=0}^{M}\sum\limits_{j=0}^{N}c_{i,j}}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      c_{0,0} & c_{0,1} & \dots & c_{0,n} \\
      c_{1,0} & c_{1,1} & \dots & c_{1,n} \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      c_{m,0} & c_{m,1} & \dots & c_{m,n}
    \end{bmatrix}
  \]
