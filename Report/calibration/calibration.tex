\chapter{System Calibrations}

This section of the report details the different parameters for calibrating the computer vision algorithm and how they affect the algorithms behaviour. Critical to the system's function is its correct calibration as computer vision algorithm is sensitive to changes in location each location has to specifically calibrated.

\section{Calibration File}

All calibrations are specified in a configuration file that is read by the algorithm at its commencement. The parameters that can be calibrated, their name in the file, their purpose and effect are as listed below.
