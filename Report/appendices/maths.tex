    \section{Bayes Theorem}
    \label{section:bayes}

    Bayes Theorem states that A and B are independent random variables and that the conditional probability of A given B, $P(A|B)$, can be determined as a function of the conditional probability of B given A, $P(B|A)$, and the marginal probabilities of A and B, $P(A)$ and $P(B)$.

    
    \begin{equation}
        P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
        \label{eq:bayes}
    \end{equation}
