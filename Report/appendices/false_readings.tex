\chapter{False Readings}

This section of the Appendices outlines the causes of false readings for the test detailed in the results, Table \ref{table:volume_table}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item ID - is the unique identifier for the traffic setting.
    \item Lane - refers to the lane(s) that the false reading occurred in. R - right, L - left, T - top and B - bottom. E.g. the right most lane of a three lane highway is R3.
    \item Type - specifies the nature of the fault, e.g. false positive or false negative. Referred to as FP and FN respectively.
    \item Frame \# - refers to the frame number at which the false reading occurred in the test video.
    \item Description - provides more information pertaining to the cause of the false reading.
\end{itemize}
