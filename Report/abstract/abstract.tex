\begin{abstract}

The following report details the design and theoretical background for a system of cameras that use computer vision to collect traffic statistics from a network. The system was designed to solve the problem of collecting vehicle volume data of vehicles moving across each cameras view. The system primarily utilizes background subtraction and object tracking to count vehicles. The system achieved the best results when its cameras were looking down on the traffic network from above but achieved an average accuracy of 95\% for data sampled from 8 different traffic settings.
