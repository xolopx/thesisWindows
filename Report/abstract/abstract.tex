    Traffic congestion is a growing issue in urban centers and not only wastes time and money but is a large contributor of carbon emissions. A lightweight traffic data capture system could be used to reduce data collection costs and increase the amount of data available to traffic network stakeholders. A system that utilizes computer vision to produce real-time traffic data running on an embedded system serves this purpose. This thesis explores the design, testing and implementation of a network of cameras that capture video of sections of a traffic network and use a computer vision algorithm based on background subtraction to determine the volume of traffic at that location where the data collected is transmitted to a central database for the use of stakeholders. An exploration of existing traffic data collection methods was performed and an investigation into computer vision techniques appropriate for object detection and tracking was undertaken to arrive at this system. In tests conducted on seven different traffic scenarios the system achieved an average and median F1 value of 94.40\% and 96.00\% respectively for vehicle volume counts.
