    Traffic congestion is a growing issue in urban centers that contributes to carbon emissions and wastes time and money. A lightweight traffic data capture system could be used to reduce data collection costs and increase the amount of data available to traffic network stakeholders. A system that utilizes computer vision to produce real-time traffic data running on an embedded system serves this purpose. This thesis explores the design, testing and implementation of a network of cameras that capture video of sections of a traffic network and use a computer vision algorithm based on background subtraction to determine the volume and approximate speed of traffic at that location. An exploration of existing traffic data collection methods was performed and an investigation into computer vision techniques appropriate for object detection and tracking was undertaken to arrive at this system. In 8 different traffic settings the system achieved an average accuracy of 95\% for vehicle volume counts. For camera perspectives perpendicular to the direction of vehicle movement a speed measuring accuracy of 95\% was achieved. These results demonstrate that an effective lightweight system for traffic monitoring can be developed.
